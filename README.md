# CMSify
Build a CMS-style blog application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

# Description 
This project involves creating a structured system for managing content with clear separation of data, user interface, and application logic. Features include creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts, user authentication, and comment management. The app will use Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session for authentication. Deploy the final application to Render.
